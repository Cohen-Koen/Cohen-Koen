## About Me:
### I am a high school student in Tennesee ('26) studying mathematics and physics. My specialty lies in order theory which I have studied the most (graduate level study at my uni), a little bit too comfortable to zornify a proof! My current studies are all around the field however a couple notable at the moment is: Numerical analysis (pursuing research in it), Measure Theory (I am applying order theory to it to dig for results), abstract algebra for physics, and I am attending my univerisity's graduate real analysis series. In physics I am hardly as deep in, so far I have only done algebra based mechanics, calculus based mechanics, calculus based electromagnetism, and now Modern Physics which is my university's basic quantum mechanics and special relativity courses (however I am looking to further challenge myself!). <br> <br>
I find myself particuarly fascinated with complex analysis however my university has one complex variables class which is a graduate course in the spring. So, I am planning to study it at the university I end up at for the class of 2030.
